## Description

This simple android game was designed in Unity. The idea is that the user plays as a surfer, in a cosmos themed environment, and attempts to dodge a variety of obstacles. The difficulty of the game is determined by the speed the player moves, and the number of obstacles that spawn, which both increase with time.

The player must dodge the obstacles by either moving left or right. The player cannot move directly forward and must either glide left or right for the entirety of the game, this is an important restriction that aims to increase the difficulty of the game.

This game can be found on the play store. <b> Insert link </b>
